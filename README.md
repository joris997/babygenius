Java implementation of a negotiating agent. General tactic is to 'pretent' to be conceiving by stating offers that are close to your optimimum (but some distnace from it) and subsequently yielding to something that is closer to your optimum
It was assumed this would show to the opposition that we were able to yield quite easily while in the background we were never doing this at all.
